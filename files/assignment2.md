## Tasks
Based on your wireframes from Assignment 1:

- Create at least 3 high-fidelity screens
- Create an interactive prototype based on those screens

You must use Figma for this assignment. You can choose to edit/omit certain features from your previous wireframes, provided that you mention it in your write-up.

*For those that do not want to use their previous wireframes from Assignment 1:*

You can create your high-fidelity screens and prototype based on a topic within the range of Lab Assignment 1. While the grading criteria will remain the same, do be aware that you may be at a disadvantage due to a lack of feedback from your Assignment 1. You do not have to submit any new wireframes.

## Deliverables

- Images of your high-fidelity screens (in a sub-folder)
- Images of wireframes from Assignment 1, if any (in a sub-folder)
- A short write-up with the following information:
  - What your prototype is designed for
  
    (Can be the same explanation as the last assignment)
  - A Figma link to your Project
  - List changes from previous design (if any)
  - Interesting aspects you took into consideration while designing i.e. design principles, branding..
  - For not those not following their Assignment 1] If you chose Option 2 of Assignment 1, you should include in your write-up what improvements you have made in the re-design.
   
## Grading

This constitutes 5% of your total marks for the module. The assignment is graded based on the following:

### Main (5%)

- Task fulfillment
- Clarity of write-up for design (changes made, design principles followed)
- Design of prototype e.g. spacing and positioning, interactivity of prototype, UX

### Bonus (1%)

This is an optional criteria for you to complete. It will contribute **1%** to the total marks within the assignment percentage of the module (15%).
i.e If you receive 13% out of 15% for the assignments marking of the module and a total of 3% in bonus marks, you will receive a combined score of 15% for the assignment allocation.
