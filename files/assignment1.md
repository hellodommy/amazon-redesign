Release Date: ​24th Aug, Week 3 Mon

Submission Deadline: ​7th Sep, Week 5 Mon ​0800

## Tasks

You are to complete a set of wireframes based on **​either**

1. **A design for a personal website (portfolio/lifestyle)**
2. **A re-design of a current website**
   Examples of websites: ​Amazon​, ​CraigsList​, ​Ikea​, ​McDonalds
   If you are unsure if the website you wish to do is suitable, do approach your tutor with your chosen website. Do not use any examples that were already done in the ​**Lab 1: Balsamiq**​ guide.

There is no advantage of choosing one option over the other as both will be marked based on the same criteria.

### Criteria

Your wireframes must at least include at least 3 screens:

- Home/Landing Page
- About Page
- A screen of your choice

The screens should be of size ​1024×768. ​Your wireframes should be created with Balsamiq.

## Deliverables

- Image(s)/PDF of your wireframes
- [PDF or Word] A short write-up with the following information:
  - Which option you chose
  - What your wireframes are designed for
  
    *I.e Wireframes are designed for a portfolio; Made for a redesign of the Ikea site...*
  - Explain improvements in re-design, and why you chose that site (if option 2)
  - [Optional] Any interesting aspects you took into consideration while designing
     
## Grading

This constitutes ​**5​%**​ of your total marks for the module. The assignment is graded based on the following:

### Main (5%)

- Criteria fulfillment
- Clarity of write-up for design
- Clarity of wireframes in explaining the design ​e.g. details shown, interactivity of Balsamiq wireframes

### Bonus (1%)

This is an optional criteria for you to complete. It will contribute ​**1%** ​to the total marks within the assignment percentage of the module (15%).

*i.e If you receive 13% out of 15% for the assignments marking of the module and a total of 3% in bonus marks, you will receive a combined score of 15% for the assignment allocation.*

- Creativity (if option 1)
- How well your re-design improves the site (if option 2)
