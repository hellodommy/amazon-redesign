## Tasks

Based on your Figma prototype from Assignment 2:
- Create a working website, that includes at least 3 screens from the prototype.
  - All elements that link from one page to another must work
  - You must write your own HTML and CSS code.

You can choose to edit/omit certain features from your previous wireframes, provided that you mention it in your write-up. If you are unsure if you are allowed to use certain extensions or libraries for your assignment, do approach your tutor.

_For those that did not submit their previous assignment, or do not want to use their previous work:_

You can create your working website based on a topic within the range of Assignment 1. While the grading criteria will remain the same, do be aware that you may be at a disadvantage due to a lack of feedback from previous assignments.

You do not have to submit any additional wireframes/screens/prototype. If you chose to re- design a site (option 2 of Assignment 1), you should include in your write-up what improvements you have made in the re-design and why you chose that site.

## Deliverables
- A folder with your all your `.html`/`.css`/`.js` files, in working order.
- [PDF or Word] A short write-up with the following information:
  - What your website is designed for (can be the same explanation as the last assignment)
  - List the screens from the last assignment that were chosen to be displayed
  - List changes in design (if any)
  - [Bonus] If you completed a bonus task, which task you completed and how.
  - [Optional] Any interesting aspects you would like to highlight
   
## Grading
This constitutes 5% of your total marks for the module. The marks are allocated as follows:

### Main (5%)
- Task fulfillment
- Accuracy against prototype
  -  If you did not develop the site based on your previous prototype, you will instead be graded more heavily on aesthetics and UX
-  Cleanliness of code
  
### Bonus (1%)

This is an optional criteria for you to complete. It will contribute 1% to the total marks within the assignment percentage of the module (15%).

*i.e If you receive 13% out of 15% for the assignments marking of the module and a total of 3% in bonus marks, you will receive a combined score of 15% for the assignment allocation.*

You ONLY need to complete ONE of the following for the bonus marks.

- Interactivity
- Site interactivity on your pages using Bootstrap (Lab 4), for example carousels and buttons. Any implementation through Javascript is also accepted.
  
    OR
- Responsiveness
  - Your website should be able to cater to sizes mobile, tablet and web.
  
## Submission

Put all deliverables in a ZIP file and name your ZIP file `your-student-number_lab-group_assign3.zip`. For example, `A0123456X_B20_assign3.zip`. All letters in your student number must be capitalized.

Submit your ZIP file to the Assignment 3 Submission folder in LumiNUS Files. Before the submission deadline, you may upload your ZIP file as many times as you want to the correct folder. We will take only your latest submission. If you have uploaded a new version to the folder, you must delete the older versions.
